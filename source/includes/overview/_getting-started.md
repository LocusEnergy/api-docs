## Getting started

Before you begin, you should already have the items below. If you don't, please get in touch with your Locus Energy account manager.

- API credentials. This includes a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
- SolarOS username and password
- Your partner ID

Once you have these, check out the [common workflows](#common-workflows) for some examples of how to interact with the API.
